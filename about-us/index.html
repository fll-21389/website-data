  <div id="main">
  
  <h3>We're First Lego League team 21389! Our team name is "The Pyrates." This is a play on Python, which is the language we are using to program out robot this year. We are located in Westfield, Indiana and have 3 teammates.
Our teammates are in 5th, 6th, and 8th grade. All three of our teammates have multiple years of experience, and one of our teamates has qualifed for the World competition. This year we are aiming for Worlds again
and think we will get there based on our experience, robot design, and how well our team operates. If you have any questions please reach out to us on our contact page or via email, which will appear here in the near future.
This entire website is hand-written from scratch by Alex.</h3>

<h2>Meet Alex!</h2>
<h4 height="300px">Hi there! I'm Alex and I am the lead programmer on our team. I have done a bunch with this program and I am very excited for this season! I am in 8th grade so this is my last of 7 years in a First program.
I have been eligible to attend the world competition, but unfourtunately COVID-19 hit and my team was unable to attend due to the event being canceled. Apart from the robotics, I enjoy programming in a variety of languages,
including Python, HTML, CSS, and a slight bit of JavaScript. This year I aim to program our robot via Python, and I have been working hard to get our robot going for this years challenge. I also run a YouTube channel that features
Minecraft videos and EV3 videos in the near future. I am always looking for a good opportunity for coding and creating stuff!<br></h4>

<h2 style="float:right">Nathan's Here!</h2>
<h4 style="float:right">Hello! I'm Nathan. I mainly build but I can basically do everything. I have been in robotics for 3 years(this is my third). I like a challenge without being pressured. This year, I am the youngest 
  but I still fit into the team. I have learned a lot from LEGO robotics, including how to do basic block coding, building, and good team skills. Last year I was the main programmer. Since we are using Python this year,
   Alex took over on the programming, so I mainly build with Parker, set up the board, or learn little bits of Python with Alex. I like improving computer hardware and fixing things. I also love working on advanced projects.</h4>
